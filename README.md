# 3-cups-game

https://icm213.github.io/3-cups-game/

Hello! It's my first game created with JavaScript. I've started coding it about 4 weeks ago, to learn that language. 
At the beginning it was a very simple project, in which I have had in mind to manage with CSS animations. But when I've started to code, new ideas for functionality came across.

In this game you have to select a cup. One of them has a ball inside. When you click it, you win the game. In every tour you have two chances to choose right cup. 
When you select right cup by first chance, you get points. But if you chose wrong cup twice, you lose them. Each difficuilty level (besides first two) has diffrent score value. When you acknowledge that diffiluilty level is too easy or too hard, you can change it after finish a tour.

In future i would like to improve structure of the code, add local storage or cookies management, different skins for cups and ball (depending on score related to winnings), additional cup and so on. I hope that I will find time to do that all between work, life and learning :)

Used technologies: HTML, SASS, JavaScript.

## Have a fun!
